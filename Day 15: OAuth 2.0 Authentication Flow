## What it is
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows a user to grant limited access to their data on one service to another application, without sharing their password.

## Why it matters
OAuth 2.0 improves security by preventing users from sharing their passwords with third-party apps. Instead, applications receive limited access tokens, which reduces the risk of credential leaks and unauthorized access.

## One key takeaway
OAuth 2.0 separates authentication from authorization, making modern applications more secure and scalable.
