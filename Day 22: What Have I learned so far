# Day 22: What Have I Learned So Far

This day is a reflection on my cybersecurity learning journey so far.
Instead of learning a new concept, I’m documenting **how my thinking has changed** after consistent hands-on practice.

---

## 🔐 Key Realizations

- Security is mostly about **preventing abuse**, not just encryption.
- Many real-world attacks exploit **logic flaws**, not advanced exploits.
- Simple defenses like rate limiting and input validation stop a large number of attacks.

---

## 🧠 Attacker vs Defender Mindset

- Attackers look for weak defaults, missing checks, and unlimited attempts.
- Defenders must assume users will make mistakes.
- Defense-in-depth is essential — no single control is enough.

---

## 🛠 Practical Skills I’ve Gained

- Implementing rate limiting and brute-force protection
- Understanding authentication vs authorization
- Designing secure login flows
- Writing cleaner logs and documentation
- Thinking in terms of threat models

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes & Gaps I Noticed

- Initially focused too much on tools instead of fundamentals
- Underestimated the importance of documentation
- Learned that clarity beats complexity in security design

---

## 🚀 How This Changed My Approach

- I now think: *“How can this be abused?”* before writing code
- I value consistency over random bursts of work
- I focus on building **realistic, explainable security systems**

---

This reflection helps me stay grounded and improve my learning direction going forward.
