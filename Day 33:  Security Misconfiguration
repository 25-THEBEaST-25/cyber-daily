# Cyber Daily – Day 33  
## Topic: Security Misconfiguration

### What is Security Misconfiguration?
Security misconfiguration happens when systems, applications, or servers are set up incorrectly, left with default settings, or not updated properly, making them easy targets for attackers.

This is one of the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities.

### Common Examples
- Default usernames & passwords still enabled  
- Debug mode turned ON in production  
- Unnecessary ports or services left open  
- Over-permissive access (e.g., `777` permissions)  
- Exposed admin panels (`/admin`, `/phpmyadmin`)  
- Unpatched software or outdated libraries  

---

### Why It’s Dangerous
- Attackers can gain **unauthorized access**
- Leads to **data leaks**
- Enables **privilege escalation**
- Can act as an entry point for full system compromise

---

### Real-World Impact
Many data breaches happen not because of complex hacking, but because:
- Admin panels were public
- Credentials were hardcoded
- Cloud storage was left public

---

### How to Prevent Security Misconfiguration
- Change default credentials immediately  
- Disable unused services & ports  
- Apply least privilege principle  
- Keep software & dependencies updated  
- Hide admin/debug endpoints  
- Use secure headers & proper environment con
