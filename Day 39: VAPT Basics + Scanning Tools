Day 39: VAPT Basics + Scanning Tools
🔥 What is VAPT?

VAPT = Vulnerability Assessment + Penetration Testing

Vulnerability Assessment (VA): Find security weaknesses (like scanning + identifying risks)

Penetration Testing (PT): Try to exploit weaknesses safely to check real impact

✅ Common tools used in VAPT

Nmap → network scanning (ports, services, OS detection)

Nikto → web server vulnerability scanning

Nessus → vulnerability scanner (automated checks + reports)

cURL → interact with web servers (requests/testing endpoints)

🕵️ Web Crawling (in security context)

Web crawling means:
✅ automatically browsing a website to discover pages, links, and content

Used in recon to map endpoints & attack surface.

🎯 Reconnaissance (Recon)

Recon is done to:
✅ gather information about a target system or network
(example: subdomains, open ports, tech stack, endpoints)

🌐 VMware Lab Network Mode (for lab)

Most common lab setup:
✅ NAT (internet works but VM stays isolated from your real network)

🔐 SSL/TLS Misconfiguration consequences

✅ Exposure of sensitive data
✅ Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
❌ “Improved security” is NOT a consequence

✅ Today’s progress

Continued internship assessment + VAPT understanding

Practiced key concepts: recon, crawling, scanners, lab setup
