Day 41:

Today’s learning wasn’t from code or a tool, but from observing how cyber attacks actually exist in the real world.

I explored a live cyber threat map that aggregates global malicious activity in real time. Instead of focusing on the visuals, I tried to understand what it represents underneath:
- Continuous background noise of the internet
- Automated scanners looking for misconfigurations
- Credential stuffing, brute force attempts, and probing of exposed services

One important realization was that most systems are not attacked because they are “important”, but because they are simply reachable. Attackers don’t wait for permission or timing — they exploit availability.

This changed how I think about security:
- Security is not an event, it’s a state
- Attack traffic is constant, defense must be continuous
- Silence in logs doesn’t always mean safety

It also reinforced why basics matter so much:
- Closing unnecessary ports
- Strong authentication and rate limiting
- Monitoring before reacting

Reflection:
Cybersecurity isn’t about stopping attacks completely.
It’s about reducing exposure, detecting early, and responding intelligently.
