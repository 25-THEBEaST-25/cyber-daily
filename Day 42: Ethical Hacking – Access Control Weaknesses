Day 42: Ethical Hacking – Access Control Weaknesses

Focused on access control flaws today — one of the most common real-world vulnerabilities.

Key takeaways:

Broken Access Control happens when users can access resources beyond their intended permissions.

Common cases:

IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)

Missing role checks (user → admin endpoints)

Client-side authorization checks (trusting frontend logic)

Simple test approach:

Change user IDs in URLs / APIs

Reuse low-privilege tokens on high-privilege endpoints

Directly access restricted routes without UI navigation

Lesson reinforced:

Authentication proves who you are.
Authorization decides what you’re allowed to do.

Attackers don’t “hack” logins — they walk through unlocked doors.
