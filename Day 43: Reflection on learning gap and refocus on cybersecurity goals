Day 43: What was I doing for 5 days?
Over the past 5 days, I did not make visible commits to this repository, but that time was not idle or wasted. This gap was mainly due to a mix of academic commitments, tool setup, and refocusing my learning approach.

During this period:

I was engaged in coursework and internal assessments, which limited hands-on cyber practice time.

I explored different Linux environments (WSL, Ubuntu, Kali) and evaluated the best setup for bug bounty and cybersecurity learning.

I spent time understanding IAM concepts through structured learning (EduSkills / Tata Forage), focusing more on theory and clarity rather than quick commits.

I reflected on my learning direction to avoid shallow progress and instead aim for depth and practical relevance.

Key takeaway:
Consistency is not only about daily commits, but also about intentional learning and preparation. This short break helped me realign my focus toward bug bounty, practical security tooling, and a stable Linux workflow (Kali).

Going forward:

I will maintain smaller but meaningful updates.

Focus on practical labs, notes, or tool usage that directly improves my cybersecurity skillset.

Avoid long gaps without at least documenting progress or learning.

Back on track. 🚀
Cyber Daily continues.
