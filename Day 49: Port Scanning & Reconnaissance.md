## Day 49: Port Scanning & Reconnaissance (Cybersecurity Perspective)

### 🧠 What is Port Scanning?

Port scanning is a reconnaissance technique used to identify open ports and services running on a target system.

Attackers use it to find entry points, while defenders use it to detect and secure exposed services.

### 🔍 Common Open Ports & Risks

* 22 (SSH) → Brute-force attacks
* 80 (HTTP) → Web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi)
* 443 (HTTPS) → Misconfigurations
* 3306 (MySQL) → Unauthorized DB access

---

### ⚔️ Attacker Perspective

* Scan for open ports
* Identify services running
* Look for outdated/vulnerable versions
* Exploit exposed services

---

### 🛡️ Defender Perspective

* Close unused ports
* Use firewalls to restrict access
* Implement rate limiting to prevent scanning abuse
* Monitor logs for repeated connection attempts

---

### 🔥 Types of Port Scans

* TCP Connect Scan (Full connection)
* SYN Scan (Stealth scan)
* UDP Scan (Harder to detect)

---

### 💡 Key Learning

Port scanning is the **first step in most cyber attacks**.
Understanding it helps in both attacking (ethical hacking) and defending systems.

### 🚀 Practical Connection

I am building my own port scanner to understand how scanning works internally and how attackers discover vulnerabilities.

### 🔐 Defensive Tip

Always disable unnecessary services and restrict access using firewall rules to minimize attack surface.
