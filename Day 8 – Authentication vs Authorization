# Day 8 – Authentication vs Authorization

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying **who a user is**.
It usually happens during login using credentials like a password, OTP, or biometrics.

Examples:
- Username & password login
- OTP verification
- Fingerprint / Face ID

## Authorization
Authorization is the process of deciding **what an authenticated user is allowed to do**.
It is usually based on roles and permissions.

Examples:
- User can view their profile but not others’
- Admin can access dashboard settings
- Normal users cannot delete data

## Real-World Example
- Logging into Gmail → Authentication  
- Accessing admin settings or managing users → Authorization

## Security Note
Authentication and Authorization are **not the same**.
Many security issues occur when applications authenticate users correctly but fail to restrict permissions properly.
