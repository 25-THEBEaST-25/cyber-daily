# Day 20 – Input Validation & Sanitization

## What this is about
Revisiting input validation and sanitization with a focus on practical security impact.

## Why this matters
Improper input handling is one of the root causes of:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection

## Key takeaway
Never trust user input — validate what you expect, sanitize what you display.

## Real-world impact
Improper input validation has caused major security breaches in the real world:
- XSS leading to session hijacking
- SQL Injection exposing entire databases
- Command Injection resulting in server takeover

Most of these attacks happen not because of complex bugs,
but because basic input checks were skipped.

## Common developer mistakes
- Trusting client-side validation alone
- Using blacklists instead of whitelists
- Not validating input length and type
- Forgetting to sanitize output before rendering
