# Day X – Password Attacks

## 1. Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack tries **all possible combinations** of characters until the correct password is found.
It is slow but guaranteed to work if no protection is applied.

**Defense:**
- Account lockout
- Rate limiting
- Strong passwords

---

## 2. Dictionary Attack
Instead of all combinations, attackers use a **predefined list of common passwords**.
Much faster than brute force.

**Defense:**
- Avoid common passwords
- Enforce password complexity

---

## 3. Credential Stuffing
Attackers use **leaked username–password pairs** from other breaches.
Works because people reuse passwords.

**Defense:**
- Unique passwords per site
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)

---

## Key Takeaway
Most attacks succeed due to **weak or reused passwords**, not advanced hacking.
