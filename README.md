# Cyber Daily

A daily cybersecurity learning log focused on practical security concepts, real-world attack surfaces, and defensive thinking.

This repository documents my consistent practice in cybersecurity — one focused topic per day.

## Why Cyber Daily?

Security is not learned in bursts — it’s built through consistency.

This repo represents:
- Daily threat-model thinking
- Hands-on experimentation
- Concept reinforcement through writing
