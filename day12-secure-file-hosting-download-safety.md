## 🛡️ Cyber Daily – Day 12  
**Topic:** Secure File Hosting & Download Safety (GitHub Pages Case Study)

### 🔍 What I Learned
While deploying my personal portfolio on GitHub Pages, I faced issues with securely hosting and serving a resume PDF file. This highlighted real-world challenges in static file hosting and access control.

### ⚠️ Key Issues Identified
- Incorrect file paths causing 404 errors
- Case-sensitive filenames breaking production links
- File extension mismatches (`.pdf` vs `.pdf.pdf`)
- Binary files not being editable directly on GitHub
- Importance of correct relative paths in static websites

### 🛠️ Fixes & Best Practices
- Ensured correct file upload and naming (`resume.pdf`)
- Used relative paths (`./resume.pdf`) for reliability
- Verified file presence in repository root
- Used `download` attribute in anchor tags for safe downloads
- Tested file access via deployed GitHub Pages URL

### 🔐 Security Takeaways
- Always validate file paths in production
- Prevent broken links that can reduce user trust
- Ensure sensitive documents are intentionally exposed
- Static hosting still requires security awareness

### 🚀 Outcome
Successfully fixed the resume download button on my live portfolio and gained hands-on experience with secure static file handling.

**Skill Gained:** Secure deployment awareness & production debugging
